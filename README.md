# csstagged

## Synopsis

CSSTagged visualizes a number of important signs of the overall health of
the CSS of HTML based development projects. Information such as how rules are
nested, how much inheritance and reuse is occurring, name duplications, and
providing a way for rules to be expressed in isolation are all valuable to
creating projects that are scalable and manageable long term.
